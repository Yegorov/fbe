# A concluding block.
#
# You may want to use this class when you want to go through a number
# of facts in the factbase, applying certain algorithm to each of them
# and possibly creating new facts from them.
#
# For example, you want to make a new +good+ fact for every +bad+ fact found:
#
#  require 'fbe/conclude'
#  conclude do
#    on '(exist bad)'
#    follow 'when'
#    draw on |n, b|
#      n.good = 'yes!'
#    end
#  end
#
# This snippet will find all facts that have +bad+ property and then create
# new facts, letting the block in the {Fbe::Conclude#draw} deal with them.
